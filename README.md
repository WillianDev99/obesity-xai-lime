## üßæ Research Objective

The main objective of this work is to explain how machine learning models identify different levels of obesity using the LIME interpretability technique. This contributes to increasing trust and transparency in AI systems applied in the medical domain.

## üìñ Dataset

The <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition"><strong>original dataset</strong></a> includes data for estimating obesity levels in individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 17 attributes and 2,111 records, labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), which allows for classification using the values Underweight, Normal Weight, Level I Overweight, Level II Overweight, Type I Obesity, Type II Obesity, and Type III Obesity. Seventy-seven percent of the data was generated synthetically using the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, and 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform.

## üß† Machine Learning Models

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

* Extra Trees Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
* Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
* Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
